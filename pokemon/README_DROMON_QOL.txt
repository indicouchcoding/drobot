DroMon QOL update
- Removed hint system entirely (no storage, no display).
- New spawn message: "TwitchLit A wild <name> appears TwitchLit Catch it using !throw (winners revealed in <despawn>s)".
- Throw aliases + default:
    * !throw  → use your default (starts as pokeball)
    * !throw pb|gb|ub  → alias for pokeball/greatball/ultraball
    * !setthrow <pb|gb|ub>  → set your default
- Help command renamed: !pokehelp (kept !help).
- Optional improvement: forced !spawn now also resets auto-spawn timer to keep the cadence clean.
